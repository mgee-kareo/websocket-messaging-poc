# Goal of POC:
Demonstrate whether it is feasible to use websockets with springboot, especially whether it is possible to send a message to one specific user vs another.

# How to launch and run:

1) open the application in Intellij, go into `gs-messaging-stomp-websocket/complete`, and run `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.
2) Go to `localhost:8080` in a browser window. Open a separate private browser window and direct to `localhost:8080`.
3) Hit the `connect` button in both browser windows.
4) Put your public name into the field for public names and hit `send`.  You should see a greeting across all the windows.
5) Put your private name in the field for private names and hit the associated `send` button.  You should only see the private name in the window where you pressed send.
